### :star2:OpenGDA: Graph Domain Adaptation Benchmark for Cross-network Learning :star2:

:seedling: :seedling: Currently we are building this project with more models and datasets.:seedling::seedling:  

#### What is OpenGDA?

OpenGDA is a benchmark which integrates 1) datasets for evaluating diverse cross-network learning tasks and 2) state-of-the-art graph domain adaptation models. 

- **cross-network learning task:**  To alleviate the lack of high-quality labels and the sparse graph structure, reseachers build cross-network learning task by introducing relevent source graphs to transfer labeling and structural knowledge to target graphs. The goal of cross-network learning task is improving task performance on target graphs by transferring knowledge from source graphs.
- **graph domain adaptation:** Researchers improve domain adaptation techinique by taking the properties of structured graph data into account.

#### Why establish OpenGDA?

Currently, there mainly exist two limitations in evaluating graph domain adaptation models. 

- **Task-limitation:**  GDA models are primarily tested for the specific cross-network node classification task, leaving tasks at edge-level and graph-level largely under-explored.
- **Scenario-limitation:** GDA models are primarily tested in limited scenarios, such as social networks or citation networks, lacking validation ofmodelâ€™s capability in richer scenarios. 

As comprehensively assessing models could enhance model practicality in real-world applications, we propose a benchmark, known as OpenGDA. **It provides abundant pre-processed and unified datasets for different types of tasks (node, edge, graph). They originate from diverse scenarios, covering web information systems, urban systems and natural systems. Furthermore, it integrates state-of-the-art models with standardized and end-to-end pipelines.** Overall, OpenGDA provides a user-friendly, scalable and reproducible benchmark for evaluating graph domain adaptation models.

#### How to use OpenGDA?

##### Requirements

###### About gpu environment

We have tested under multiple environments and here we list some of them:

- cuda 10.2, pytorch 1.8.1+cu102, torch-geometric 2.0.2
- cuda 11.3, pytorch1.10.2+cu113, torch-geometric 2.0.3

###### packages

We mainly require `pytorch` as neural network framework and `torch-geometric` as GNN framework.
